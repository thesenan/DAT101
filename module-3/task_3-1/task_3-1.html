      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the the wake-up time is 7, the "if" statement will print out: I can catch the bus to school. If it's not 7 the "if" statement will not print out anything. </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If it's 7 the "if" statement behaves the same, but if the wake-up time is not 7, an "else" will be triggered and print out: I have to drive the car to school. </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>An "else" will be triggered and will print out: I have to drive the car to school. </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is exactly 0, it is treated as if its neither positive or negative.</p>
